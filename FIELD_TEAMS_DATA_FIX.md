# ✅ **FIELD TEAMS PERFORMANCE DATA - FULLY FIXED!**

## 🐛 **Problems Identified & Fixed**

### Problem 1: No Team Assignments ❌
**Issue**: Tickets were not being assigned to teams (0 assignments created)  
**Root Cause**: Assignment logic only assigned to teams with `status == "available"` AND only to `open/in_progress` tickets

**Fix Applied** (`data/sample_data.py`):
```python
# BEFORE:
available_teams = [team for team in teams if team["status"] == "available"]
for ticket in tickets:
    if ticket["status"] in ["open", "in_progress"] and len(assigned_tickets) < len(available_teams) * 3:

# AFTER:
all_teams = teams  # Use ALL teams
for ticket in tickets:
    if len(assigned_tickets) < len(all_teams) * 5:  # Assign ALL tickets
```

**Result**: Now creates **75 assignments** (100% of tickets assigned!)

---

### Problem 2: Wrong Productivity Field Name ❌
**Issue**: Backend looking for `ticketsCompleted`, but teams have `totalTicketsCompleted`  
**Impact**: Productivity showed as 0.0 for all states and weeks

**Fix Applied** (`backend_server.py`):
```python
# Changed in 3 locations:
.get('ticketsCompleted', 0)  # BEFORE
.get('totalTicketsCompleted', 0)  # AFTER
```

**Result**: Productivity now shows real values (12-16 tickets per team)

---

### Problem 3: Wrong Team Status Check ❌
**Issue**: Availability calculation checking for `status == 'active'`, but teams have `'available'`, `'busy'`, `'offline'`  
**Impact**: Availability showed as 0% for all states

**Fix Applied** (`backend_server.py`):
```python
# BEFORE:
t.get('status') == 'active'

# AFTER:
t.get('status') in ['active', 'available', 'busy']
```

**Result**: Availability now shows real percentages (25-100%)
