## Algorithm Details

The intelligent assignment algorithm uses a weighted scoring system:

### Scoring Factors
1. **Productivity (30%)**: Based on past performance, customer ratings, and completion efficiency
2. **Availability (20%)**: Current availability status and working hours
3. **Cost (20%)**: Hourly rate and travel cost efficiency
4. **Distance (20%)**: Geographic proximity and estimated travel time
5. **Skills (10%)**: Match between required skills and team member capabilities

### Score Calculation
```
Total Score = (Productivity √ó 0.3) + (Availability √ó 0.2) + (Cost √ó 0.2) + (Distance √ó 0.2) + (Skills √ó 0.1)
```
